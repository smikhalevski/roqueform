# Motivation

Here are the requirements I wanted the management solution to satisfy:

- Everything should be strictly typed up to the very field value setter, so the string value from the silly input would
  be set to the number-typed value in the form value object.

- There should be no restrictions on how and when the input is submitted because data submission is generally
  an application-specific process.

- There are many approaches to validation, and a great number of awesome validation libraries. The form library must
  be agnostic to where (client-side, server-side, or both), how (on field or form level), and when (sync, or async)
  the validation is handled.

- Validation errors aren't standardized, so an arbitrary error object shape must be allowed and related typings must be
  seamlessly propagated to the error consumers/renderers.

- No excessive re-renders of unchanged fields.

# Walkthrough

Form lifecycle consists of four separate phases: Input, Validate, Display Errors, and Submit. These phases can be
represented as non-intersecting black boxes. The result obtained during one phase may be used as an input for another
phase:

- The user inputs form values;
- The input is validated;
- Validation errors are displayed;
- Input is submitted;
- Errors received from the backend are displayed.

Phases are non-intersecting, and can happen in a different order, or even in parallel as with async validation.

Roqueform provides a robust API for the input state management and a flexible [enhancers API](#enhancers) to extend the
functionality.

## `useField`

The central piece of Roqueform is a `useField` hook that returns a `Field` object that represents a node in a tree of
form input controllers:

```ts
import { useField } from 'roqueform';

const unconstrainedField = useField();
// â†’ Field<any, {}>
```

You can provide an initial value to a field:

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: 'bar' });
// â†’ Field<{ foo: string }, {}>
```

You can derive new fields from the existing ones using `at` method:

```ts
const fooField = field.at('foo');
// â†’ Field<string, {}>
```

`fooField` is a derived field, it is linked to the parent `field`. Fields returned by the `at` method have a stable
identity, so you can invoke `at` with the same key multiple times and the same field instance would be returned:

```ts
field.at('foo') === field.at('foo') // â†’ true
```

Fields can be derived at any depth:

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: [{ bar: 'qux' }] });

field.at('foo').at(0).at('bar');
// â†’ Field<string, {}>
```

### Field value updates

The field is essentially a container that encapsulates the value and provides methods to update it. Let's have a look at
the `dispatchValue` method that updates the field value:

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: 'bar' });

field.value // â†’ { foo: 'bar' }

field.dispatchValue({ foo: 'qux' });

// The field value was updated
field.value // â†’ { foo: 'qux' }
```

`useField` doesn't trigger a re-render of the enclosing component. Navigate to
[Field observability](#field-observability) section for more details.

When the parent field is updated using `dispatchValue`, all of the affected derived fields also receive an update:

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: 'bar' });
const fooField = field.at('foo');

field.value    // â†’ { foo: 'bar' }
fooField.value // â†’ 'bar'

// Updating the root field
field.dispatchValue({ foo: 'qux' });

// The update was propagated to the derived field
field.value    // â†’ { foo: 'qux' }
fooField.value // â†’ 'qux'
```

The same is valid for updating derived fields: when the derived field is updated using `dispatchValue`, the update is
propagated to the parent field.

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: 'bar' });
const fooField = field.at('foo');

// Updating the derived field
fooField.dispatchValue('qux');

// The update was propagated to the parent field
field.value    // â†’ { foo: 'qux' }
fooField.value // â†’ 'qux'
```

`dispatchValue` has a callback signature:

```ts
fooField.dispatchValue(prevValue => 'qux');
```

### Transient updates

The field update can be done transiently, so the parent won't be notified. You can think about this as a commit in git:
you first stage your changes with `git add` and then commit them with `git commit`.

To achieve this behavior we're going to use `setValue`/`dispatch` instead of `dispatchValue` that we discussed in
[Field value updates](#field-value-updates) section:

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: 'bar' });
const fooField = field.at('foo');

// Set the transient value, "git add"
fooField.setValue('qux');

// ðŸŸ¡ Notice that fooField was updated but field wasn't
field.value    // â†’ { foo: 'bar' }
fooField.value // â†’ 'qux'

// Notify the parent, "git commit"
fooField.dispatch();

// Now both fields are in sync
field.value    // â†’ { foo: 'qux' }
fooField.value // â†’ 'qux'
```

`setValue` can be called multiple times, but the most recent update would be propagated to the parent only after
`dispatch`/`dispatchValue` call.

You can check that the field has a transient value using `transient` property:

```ts
const field = useField({ foo: 'bar' });
const fooField = field.at('foo');

fooField.setValue('qux');

fooField.transient // â†’ true

fooField.dispatch();

fooField.transient // â†’ false
```

### Field observability

Fields are observable, you can subscribe to them and receive a callback whenever the field state is updated:

```ts
field.subscribe(targetField => {
  // Handle the update here
});
```

`targetField` is a field that initiated the update, so this can be `field` itself, any of its derived fields, or any of
its ancestors (if `field` is also a derived field).

You can trigger all listeners that are subscribed to the field with `notify`:

```ts
field.notify();
```

## `Field`

The `Field` component subscribes to the given field instance and re-renders its children when the field is updated:

```tsx
import { Field, useField } from 'roqueform';

const App = () => {
  const rootField = useField('foo');

  return (
    <Field field={rootField}>
      {rootField => (
        <input
          value={rootField.value}
          onChange={event => {
            rootField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      )}
    </Field>
  );
};
```

Now, when a user would update the input value, the `rootField` would be updated. The single argument passed to
`children` render function is the field passed as a `field` prop to the `Field` component.

It is unlikely that you would use a form with a single literal field. Most of the time multiple derived fields are
required:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const rootField = useField({ foo: 'bar', bar: 123 });

  return <>
    <Field field={rootField.at('foo')}>
      {fooField => (
        <input
          type="text"
          value={fooField.value}
          onChange={event => {
            fooField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      )}
    </Field>

    <Field field={rootField.at('bar')}>
      {barField => (
        <input
          type="number"
          value={barField.value}
          onChange={event => {
            barField.dispatchValue(event.target.valueAsNumber);
          }}
        />
      )}
    </Field>
  </>;
};
```

You may have noticed that even though we didn't specify any types yet, our fields are strictly typed. You can check this
by replacing the value dispatched to `barField`:

```diff
- barField.dispatchValue(event.target.valueAsNumber);
+ barField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
```

This would cause TypeScript to show an error that `barField` value must be of a number type.

### Eager and lazy re-renders

Let's consider the form with two `Field` elements. One of them renders the value of the root field and the other one
updates the derived field:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const rootField = useField({ bar: 'qux' });

  return <>
    <Field field={rootField}>
      {rootField => JSON.stringify(rootField.value)}
    </Field>

    <Field field={rootField.at('bar')}>
      {barField => (
        <input
          type="text"
          value={barField.value}
          onChange={event => {
            barField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      )}
    </Field>
  </>;
};
```

By default, `Form` component re-renders only when the provided field was updated directly, so updates from ancestors or
derived fields would be ignored. Add the `eagerlyUpdated` property to force `Field` to re-render whenever its value was
affected.

```diff
- <Field field={rootField}>
+ <Field
+   field={rootField}
+   eagerlyUpdated={true}
+ >
    {rootField => JSON.stringify(rootField.value)}
  </Field>
```

Now both fields are re-rendered when user edits the input text.

### Reacting to changes

[Subscribing to a field](#field-observability) isn't always convenient. Instead, you can use an `onChange` handler that
is triggered only when the field value was updated [non-transiently](#transient-updates).

```tsx
<Field
  field={rootField.at('bar')}
  onChange={value => {
    // Handle the value change
  }}
>
  {barField => (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={barField.value}
      onChange={event => {
        barField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
      }}
    />
  )}
</Field>
```

## Enhancers

Enhancers are a very powerful mechanism that allows enriching fields with custom functionality.

Let's enhance the field with the `ref` property that would hold the `RefObject`:

```ts
import { createRef } from 'react';
import { useField } from 'roqueform';

const rootField = useField(
  { bar: 'qux' },

  field => Object.assign(field, { ref: createRef<HTMLInputElement>() })
);
// â†’ Field<{ bar: string }, { ref: RefObject<HTMLInputElement> }> & { ref: RefObject<HTMLInputElement> }
```

The second argument of the `useField` hook is the enhancer function that accepts a field instance and enriches it with
the new functionality. In our case it adds the `ref` to each field derived from the `rootField` and to the `rootField`
itself.

```tsx
<Field field={rootField.at('bar')}>
  {barField => (
    <input
      // ðŸŸ¡ Notice the ref property
      ref={barField.ref}
      value={barField.value}
      onChange={event => {
        barField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
      }}
    />
  )}
</Field>
```

After the `Field` mounts we can use ref to imperatively scroll the input element into view:

```ts
rootField.at('bar').ref.current?.scrollIntoView();
```

Roqueform is shipped with ref enhancer implementation:

```ts
import { useField, withRef } from 'roqueform';

const rootField = useField({ bar: 'qux' }, withRef<HTMLInputElement>());
// â†’ Field<{ bar: string }, WithRef<HTMLInputElement>> & WithRef<HTMLInputElement>
```

### Composing enhancers

You may want to use multiple enhancers at the same time, but `useField` allows passing only one enhancer function. To
combine multiple enhancers into one, use `compose` helper function:

```ts
import { compose, useField, withRef } from 'roqueform';

const enhancer = compose(withRef(), anotherEnhancer);
```

# Validation

Roqueform can be enhanced with an arbitrary validation mechanism. To showcase how validation can be implemented,
Roqueform is shipped with the `withErrors` enhancer and `useErrors` hook:

```ts
import { ReactNode } from 'react';
import { useErrors, useField, withErrors } from 'roqueform';

const errors = useErrors<ReactNode>();

const rootField = useField({ bar: 'qux' }, withErrors(errors));
```

`errors` now holds the `Errors` object, which is an observable mapping from a `Field` to the associated error. In this
example, errors are typed as `ReactNode` but you can use any type that suits your needs.

To associate an error with the field you can update `errors`:

```ts
errors.set(rootField.at('bar'), 'Oh, snap!');
```

Or you can use the new field method introduced by the `withErrors` enhancer:

```ts
rootField.at('bar').setError('Oh, snap!');
```

`withErrors` also added `invalid` and `error` fields to the `rootField` and its derived fields, to simplify error
rendering:

```tsx
<Field field={rootField.at('bar')}>
  {barField => (
    <>
      <input
        value={barField.value}
        onChange={event => {
          barField.dispatchValue(event.target.value);
        }}
        // ðŸŸ¡ Notice the invalid property 
        aria-invalid={barField.invalid}
      />
      {barField.error}
    </>
  )}
</Field>
```

# Accessors

When you derive a new field or update a derived field, Roqueform uses an accessor to read and write a value to the
parent field. You can alter the way field values are read and written by providing a custom implementation of `Accessor`
interface to `AccessorContext`.

```tsx
import { objectAccessor, AccessorContext } from 'roqueform';

<AccessorContext.Provider value={objectAccessor}>
  {/* useField should go here */}
</AccessorContext.Provider>
```
